This folder contains the analysis performed related to MaxFuse in the paper "High resolution single cell maps reveals distinct cell organization and function across different regions of the human intestine".

Note this set analysis used the development version of Maxfuse, also deposited in the [folder](https://github.com/shuxiaoc/maxfuse/tree/main/Archive/MaxFuse_devo/09302022V).

Since in the MaxFuse paper similar data were used, as that the preprocessing of the data were all the same, for that part please refer to the code that relates to ```codex``` and ```rna``` in [folders](https://github.com/shuxiaoc/maxfuse/tree/main/Archive/hubmap/code/preparation).

The script in this folder only contains the running of MaxFuse and the relevant downstream analysis presented in the paper "High resolution single cell maps reveals distinct cell organization and function across different regions of the human intestine".
